/**
 * @title DSCEngine
 * @author Shawn Rizo
 *
 * The system is designed to be as minimal as possible, and have the tokens maintain a 1 token == $1 peg.
 * This stablecoin has the properties:
 * - Exogenous Collateral
 * - Dollar Pegged
 * - Algorithmically Stable
 *
 * It is similar to DAI if DAI had no governance, no feees, and was only backed by WETH and WBTC.
 *
 * Our DSC system should always be "overcollateralized". At no point, should the value of all collateral <= the $ backed value of all the DSC.
 *
 * @notice This contract is the core of the DSC System. It handles all the logic for minting and redeeming DSC, as well as depositing & withdrawing collateral.
 * @notice This contract is very loosely based on the MakerDAO DSS (DIA) system.
